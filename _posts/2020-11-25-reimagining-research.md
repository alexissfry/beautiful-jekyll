#### Identify a statistical question that you could ask. 
How accurate is Google Heath at predicting the onset of acute kidney injury at least one day before the injury occurs?

#### Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
All people that are susceptible to accute kidney injury. This means that they might have a build-up of waste products in their blood, so potentially this population would have struggled with alcolholism for example. 

#### Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
All patients are from New York City. NYC provides a good sample frame because its population is diverse and large (~8.4 million), prividing variance in background. 

#### Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
Interval sampling. This method will provide a certain randomness, so that, for instance, two people don't come from the same household. 

#### Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.
Null: Google Health is not able to predict the onset of acute kidney injury at least one day before the injury occurs.
Alternative: Google Health is able to predict the onset of acute kidney injury at least one day before the injury occurs.

#### Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.
Variables and treatments: the use of Google Health, whether or not the patient has an acute kidney injury.

#### Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.
Group 1: Use Google Health to predict the injury and provide medical help before the injury occurs to prevent it.
Group 2 (control): Do not use Google Health and provide medical help once the injury occurs to treat it.
The treatment would be assigned randomly.

#### Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.
After the sample frame and sampling method is gathered and executed, then I would create group 1 and group 2 amongst members of my sampling frame. After the data is collected, I would look at Google Health's accuracy in identifying patients with acute kidney injury. Further, I would look at the kidney health of patients from both groups and compare. 

#### What biases may come up, and how would you address them?
Limiting the sample frame to NYC might allow for bias. I am not completely sure if the NYC population might have access to resources that would weaken their kidney health more than other areas in the world. Additionaly, there might be bias in Google Heath's AI. Since I'm not sure how exactly that system operates, it is likely that some data that it uses to make predictions is skewed as humans often skew data and that data is used to build the system's ability to make predictions.
