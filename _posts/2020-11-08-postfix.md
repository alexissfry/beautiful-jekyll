            stack.push(float(list[i])) # if it's a number, then push it onto the stack 
        else:
            a = stack.pop() # if it's not, then assign the last two values at the top of the stack to a and then the second to b
            b = stack.pop()
        if list[i] == "+": # add them if the operand is a + and push the sum to the stack
            c = b + a
            stack.push(c)
        elif list[i] == "-": # subtract them if the operand is a - and push the difference to the stack
            c = b - a

        e = evaluate(row)
        print(e)

        print(row)
print(average(avgFinal)) # computes and prints the total average of all rows 
```
# Average of the Final Value 
The final average of the values is 529.91.

#  The Use of Stack
Stack is used to reorder the evaluated numbers in each row. When the value within the row is not a operation symbol, then it will push the element onto the stack, meaning it will just append it to the list. If the element is a operand, then it will set a and b to the last two elements in the stack. Depending on the operand, which is determined with if statements, a and b will be evaluated accordingly and then that value will be pushed onto the stack. 

# My Process
For a while, my code kept returning the initial value within each row. I soon realized that my indentation in my evaluate method was wrong, which was why it would continue to return the first value in each row rather than the evaluated number. Second, I had some type issues when calculating the average with my average method. After carefully reviewing my code, I realized I was just returning stack instead of stack.peek() on accident which was giving me type errors since you can't sum and divide stacks. I needed to use stack.peek() because that will return the last value of the list or the top element of the stack. I definitely learned how to find bugs a bit better and code more dynamically. In terms of who I worked with, I checked my final average value with Harry. In terms of how to improve my code, I could have done something much cleaner to identify operands. My current method is painful on terms of efficiency as you must go through each if or elif statements. Let's say there were thousands of operands I had to identify, then this chained if statement method would be incredibly inefficient and probably crash my poor laptop. Besides the if statements, using the Stack class most definitely increased my efficiency. Whenever I needed to respond to a certain operand, I implemented components of the Stack class, attached to different methods, to do so. I think that data structures like Stacks are super cool given their ability to increase efficiency, so I'm excited to learn more about implementing these data structures in my code.
