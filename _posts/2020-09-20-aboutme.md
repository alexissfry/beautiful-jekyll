# Prior Experience
Throughout my time at Horace Mann, I've taken CS 1, CS 2, and AP Computer Science in that order. Outside of HM, I taught myself iOS app development with Swift and dabbled in Python/HTML/CSS at hackathons this summer. At hackathons, I've used Firebase to do backend with apps and have done stuff with APIs too, specifically the Spotify API. I'm driven to learn computer science because of the application of it-- it's fascinating! Particularly, the ability to impact with technical products-- that's super meaningful to me and why I really like hackathons. I also really need to learn Git better (so yay to I'm learning now), because when working with teams during hackathons, it's so so important.

# What I Like
I really love origami; if you do too, check [this](https://www.instagram.com/icarus.mid.air/) out! So cool, right? I am also obsessed with Disney (disclaimer: I acknowledge the issues embedded in their stories and narratives, but watching Disney movies is like my comfort food). I have been to the Disney parks 23 times with my family at this point! ![Disney](https://www.bestoforlando.com/common_resources/resize_library/wdw-parks-logo-1050x420.jpg)

# What I'm Looking Forward To
I am looking forward to focusing on stuff I like-- origami, hackathons, weSTEM (an impact startup build out of CS2 Shark Tank !!!), and just enjoying learning without the pressure of impending deadlines--  after finishing college apps!
