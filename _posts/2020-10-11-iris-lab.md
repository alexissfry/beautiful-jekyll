# Petal Analysis
Iris-setosa average petal length: 1.464
Iris-versicolor average petal length: 4.26
Iris-virginica average petal length: 5.552

On average, the species with the longest petal length is the Iris-virginica. The average petal lengths of the Iris-versicolor and the Iris-setosa were less than the Iris-virginica's by 1.292 and 4.088 respectively. 



# Sepal Analysis
Iris-setosa sepal width: 3.4180000000000006
Iris-versicolor sepal width: 2.7700000000000005
Iris-virginica sepal width: 2.9739999999999998

On average, the species with the widest sepal width is the Iris-setosa. The average sepal widths of the Iris-versicolor and the Iris-virginica were less than the Iris-setosa's by 0.648 and 0.444 respectively. 

# My Process
I first reminded myself of how the data was structured in the iris.csv file. Then, I created a dictionary to contain elements comprising the plant species as the keys and a list of the corresponding petal lengths as the values. Using the same method, I created a second dictionary containing elements with the plant species as the keys and lists of corresponding sepal widths as the values. After I reorganized the data in that structure, I had to find out how to access the values, the lists containing the numbers I want to average, and how to sum and then divide that sum by the length of the list. I first started in a more "hardcoded":
```
def avgSepalWidth(s):
    avgSetosaWidth = 0
    for length in sepalWidth["Iris-setosa"]:
        avgSetosaWidth += length
    return avgSetosaWidth/(len(sepalWidth["Iris-setosa"]))
```
Although this method got me the correct answer, it was not as efficient, because I would have had to create six different methods accounting for average petal length and then average sepal width for the three species. I realized I could programmatically change the species name by passing a second parameter I called "speciesName". I put my new method below.
```
def avgSepalWidth(s, speciesName):
    avgWidth = 0
    for length in sepalWidth[speciesName]:
        avgWidth += length
    return avgWidth/(len(sepalWidth[speciesName]))
```
Here, I pass speciesName as a parameter. So, when I want to find the average sepal width of a specific speies, I just pass the species name as a String in the method call. Woohoo! That upped the efficiency lots, so I was happy with that method I found out later on.

In terms of who I worked with, I did work on my code with anyone else, but I checked my average petal lengths and sepal widths with Harry.
