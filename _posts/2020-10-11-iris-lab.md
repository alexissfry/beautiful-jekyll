# Petal Analysis
#### Iris-setosa average petal length: 1.464
#### Iris-versicolor average petal length: 4.26
#### Iris-virginica average petal length: 5.552

On average, the species with the longest petal length is the Iris-virginica. The average petal lengths of the Iris-versicolor and the Iris-setosa were less than the Iris-virginica's by 1.292 and 4.088 respectively. 



# Sepal Analysis
#### Iris-setosa sepal width: 3.4180000000000006
#### Iris-versicolor sepal width: 2.7700000000000005
#### Iris-virginica sepal width: 2.9739999999999998

On average, the species with the widest sepal width is the Iris-setosa. The average sepal widths of the Iris-versicolor and the Iris-virginica were less than the Iris-setosa's by 0.648 and 0.444 respectively. 

# My Process
1. I imported the iris.csv file with the command `import csv` reminded myself of how the data was structured in the iris.csv file. 
2. Then, I created a dictionary to contain elements comprising the plant species as the keys and a list of the corresponding petal lengths as the values. Using the same method, I created a second dictionary containing elements with the plant species as the keys and lists of corresponding sepal widths as the values. 
3. After I reorganized the data in that structure, I had to find out how to access the values, the lists containing the numbers I want to average, and how to sum and then divide that sum by the length of the list. I first started in a more "hardcoded":
```
def avgSepalWidth(s):
    avgSetosaWidth = 0
    for length in sepalWidth["Iris-setosa"]:
        avgSetosaWidth += length
    return avgSetosaWidth/(len(sepalWidth["Iris-setosa"]))
```
4. Although this method got me the correct answer, it was not as efficient, because I would have had to create six different methods accounting for average petal length and then average sepal width for the three species. I realized I could dynamically change the species name by passing a second parameter I called "speciesName" as you can see below.
```
def avgSepalWidth(s, speciesName):
    avgWidth = 0
    for length in sepalWidth[speciesName]:
        avgWidth += length
    return avgWidth/(len(sepalWidth[speciesName]))
```
Here, I pass speciesName as a parameter. So, when I want to find the average sepal width of a specific species, I just pass the species name as a String in the method call. Woohoo! Then, it will iterate through the list for that specific species and sum those values. Once those values are summed, they are divided by the length of the list that I just parsed through (the number of elements since I want to find the average) and returned that value. That upped the efficiency lots, so I was happy with that method. 

In terms of who I worked with, I did work on my code with anyone else, but I checked my average petal lengths and sepal widths with Harry.
